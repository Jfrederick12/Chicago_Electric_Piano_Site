        <p>Simply owning a nearly one-of-a-kind vintage instrument sometimes just isn’t enough without its own custom look or circuit modifications. At The Chicago Electric Piano Company we understand–if not encourage–this kind of self indulgence. In addition to being able to restore your vintage piano to a point that plays better than when it left the factory, our workshop will consult with you to rebuild your instrument to obtain any custom look or sound that you are looking for. </p>
