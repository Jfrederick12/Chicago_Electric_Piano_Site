		    	<p>The Chicago Electric Piano Co. is the expert resource for servicing Rhodes, Wurlitzers, and Hohner Clavinets in addition to an array of lesser known electro-mechanical pianos and vintage keyboards. We also have extensive experience servicing Maestro, Musser, Jenco, Howard, Farfisa, Vox, Gibson and Fender organs, as well as a variety of relatively unknown vintage keyboards. From your most basic tuning to a full expert restoration of your instrument to its original glory, The Chicago Electric Piano Co. is here to restore that vintage sound that you just can’t get enough of.<br/><br/>
					Our mission is to provide the highest quality repair or restoration by holding ourselves to the highest level of integrity throughout our process in order to stay as true as possible to the original sound of the instrument. We have an inventory of sorted vintage parts for the instruments we restore and experience with the leading names in parts suppliers for acoustic and electric pianos. Throughout any restoration we only use the top quality parts from a variety of different suppliers.<br/><br/>
						In the end, any musical instrument is only going to play and sound as well as the condition of the instrument’s parts allow as well as the level of detail given to how the instrument is setup to play. And ongoing setups throughout the lifespan of the instrument play an integral role in the life and sound of the instrument. Depending on the condition of the instrument’s parts and current setup the cost of repairs and setup can vary to a great degree. Following an in depth evaluation of your instrument by our workshop we will give you a detailed estimate of the work necessary before service begins.</p>
